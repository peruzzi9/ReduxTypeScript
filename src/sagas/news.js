/* A redux saga could live in a single file containing:

a worker function (fetchNews)
a watcher function (actionWatcher)
The watcher is a generator function watching for every action we are interested in. 
In response to that action, the watcher will call a worker saga, 
which is another generator function for doing the actual API call. */
